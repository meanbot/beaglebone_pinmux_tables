# BeagleBone Pin Mux Tables

The [BeagleBone SRM][1] has the pin mux settings in it but they are spread
across many pages and are difficult to read or supply changes to.  A few
intrepid folks have tried to make Excel sheets that are easier to use but
then submitting changes is hard.

Please fork and send pull requests if anything should be changed.  I'll
accept accurate changes for any reason (formatting, spelllling, wrongness,
etc).



I'm planning to use this branch to define the first pin mux for the 
userspcae arduino project. It'll be based on the pin map of the Arduino Uno and
the Bacon cape (http://www.elinux.org/Bacon_Cape).
